		<p>This app is built in Ionic Framework using Evothings Studio.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the app is to connect to the Arduino using WiFi shield and
		and list the names of the files stored in a SD card directory.
		<p>Make sure your WiFi shield is correctly stacked on top of Arduino and it has 
		a microSD card with some files saved in /MUSIC directory.
		Next, upload the accompanying sketch to your Arduino, input the IP-address of 
		Arduino above and press connect. The app will navigate to a second view, 
		listing the file names retrieved from your SD card. </p>
