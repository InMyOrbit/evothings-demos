SD Card File List using Ionic
=============================

The app is based on Ionic Blank App project that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

This app is built in Ionic using Evothings Studio.

The purpose of the app is to connect to the Arduino using WiFi shield and
and list the names of the files stored in a SD card directory.

Make sure your WiFi shield is correctly stacked on top of Arduino and it has 
a microSD card with some files saved in /MUSIC directory.
Next, upload the accompanying sketch to your Arduino, input the IP-address of 
Arduino above and press connect. The app will navigate to a second view, 
listing the file names retrieved from your SD card.

The accompanying sketch is a level above in arduinosketch directory.
